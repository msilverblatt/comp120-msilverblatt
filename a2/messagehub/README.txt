Comp 120 - Web Engineering
Assignment 2 - MessageHub
Michael Silverblatt

In this assignment, we were to build a simple web application in rails that displays messages in real time. This application used two models, one for the application from which the messages are posted, and one for the messages themselves. The messages controller has 3 actions, create index and show. Index and show each link to a view that either displays all messages in a table or the individual message. We used the timeago plugin to add correct timestamps and jQuery/AJAX requests to update the table of messages in real time. In the model, there are validations for the presence of each piece of data along with the length of the message and username. To my knowledge, everything works as intended.

This assignment is a day late because I was in the hospital all day yesterday and have been ill recently. I can provide documentation if necessary.
