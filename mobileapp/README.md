Assignment 3: Mobile MessageHub
===============================
Michael Silverblatt

For this assignment, I chose to make an iPhone application. I successfully made two views,
one which has two labels, two text fields, and a button to send a message to the server,
and on with a table view which displays all messages from the server. I connected it to 
Ming's messagehub (messagehub.herokuapp.com) because mine is not functioning properly on
Heroku. I was able to successfully enroll in the University Developer Program and test
my app on my iPhone, which I thought was very cool. My app is very rough, as I am just learning
objective-C and iOS, but I am very glad I got this exposure to the platform.
